# Cafe Compass App Website

This is our website. Angus and Dharam will be doing most of the dev of this.

If you like, you can edit this specific document (`README.md`) or the wiki. Both of these use [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

If you want to change something else yourself, do the following:

1. Fork the project/create a new branch
2. Make your changes in the fork or the branch
3. Make a pull request

If you have an idea or feature request, please put it on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/cafecompassapp/cafecompassapp.github.io/issues).
